## Generate (and fix) a merge conflict

Your name: _____ Date: _____


This assignment provides some practice in how to create and resolve merge conflicts. First, fork the assignment from the link below:

`https://github.com:vnijs/rsm-merge-conflict-practice.git`

Next, clone the repo to your laptop using VS Code:

`git@github.com:your-id/rsm-merge-conflict-practice.git`

This is your copy (or `fork`) of the original assignment on the GitHub server. This step should create a directory `git/rsm-merge-conflict-practice` on your computer for you to work on in VS Code.

After `cloning` the assignment you should make two commits:

(1) On GitHub change only the date and commit the change on the server
(2) Add only your name above in the cloned repo on your computer and commit the change
(3) Now try to push the change from your computer to GitHub. You should get an error message that you need to pull first.
(4) Pull the changes from GitHub to your computer. You should now see a merge conflict in VS Code. Fix the merge conflict by removing the lines with `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` and commit the changes.
(5) Push the changes to GitHub. You should now see the changes on GitHub.
